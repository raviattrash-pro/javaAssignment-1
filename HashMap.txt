What is HashMap ?

HashMap -> part of the Java collection framework.

It uses a technique called Hashing.

It implements the map interface.

It stores the data in the pair of Key and Value.

HashMap contains an array of the nodes, and the node is represented as a class.

It uses an array and Linked List data structure internally for storing Key and Value. There are four fields
in HashMap.

1. hash code

2. key

3.value

4. next


Important point

If you override the equals() method, then it is mandatory to override the hashCode() method.

hashCode(): -> method of the object class.

-> returns the memory reference of the object in integer form.

-> value received -> method -> used as the bucket number.

-> bucket number -> address ->element inside the map.

-> Hash code of null Key is 0.

Buckets: -> Array of the node

-> Each node has a data structure like a LinkedList.

-> More than one node can share the same bucket.

HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

map.put(“RAM", 19);

map.put("Syam", 29);

map.put("Raju", 39);

Calculating Index

Index = hashcode(Key) & (n-1)

Where n is the size of the array. Hence the index value for “RAM" is: 2657860 & (16-1) = 4
